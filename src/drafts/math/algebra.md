## Logarithms

A logarithm is the inverse function of an exponentiation. So:

`log`<sub>`b`</sub>`x = y`&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;&nbsp;`b`<sup>`y`</sup>` = x`

For example:

`log`<sub>`2`</sub>`64 = 6`&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;`2`<sup>`6`</sup>` = 64`

In other words, the `log` base `2` of `64` is the number to which you have to raise `2` to get `64`.
