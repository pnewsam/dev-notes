# Models of Cloud Computing

## Traditional IT

Corporate data center requires servers, storage servers, a router, switch, firewall, a backup system. Very capital-intensive. You have to buy the equipment and sometimes the. A dedicated IT staff must design, build, operate, and manage equipment.

## Cloud Computing

| Cloud Computing         | Traditional IT                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| on-demand, self-service | requires human involvement                      |
| broad network access    | internal accessibility, limited public presence |
| resource pooling        | single-tenant, can be virtualized               |
| rapid elasticity        | limited scalability                             |
| measured service        | usage is not typically measured                 |

## Examples of Cloud Computing

Gmail. Dropbox, Salesforce

You don't own or manage the infrastructure the service runs on. Offered on a subscription/consumption model. Scales as demand changes.

## Cloud Service Models

- **Private Cloud**: you own the entire stack: the hardware, the hypervisor (virtualizes your OS), OS, runtime, data, web app; like owning a house
- **IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service**: you manage the virtual machine (AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine); like renting a room in a hotel
- **PaaS: Platform as a Service**: you manage data and web app; (AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure WebApps, Google Compute App Engine)
- **SaaS: Softare as a Service**: you use what they give you; (Google Apps, Salesforce, Zoom)

Private Cloud vs Public Cloud vs Hybrid Cloud vs Multicloud

- Hybrid Cloud uses both connected via the internet or a private link.
