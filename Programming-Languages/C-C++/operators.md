# Operators

# Compound Assignment

Compound assignment operators include:

```C
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=
<<=
>>=
&=
|=
^=
```

## Increment/Decrement Operators

Where the operator occurs determines whether it increments before or after assignment

Pre-increment

```C
x = 1
y = ++x;
// y = 1, x == 2
```

Post-increment

```C
x = 1
y = x++;
// y == 2, x == 2
```
